Conceptual Referential Communication
This repository contains the code used in the article "Go by its Name: Evolution and Analysis of Conceptual Referential Communication" by Siyu Yao, Joshua Nunley, and Eduardo J. Izquierdo.

Prerequisites for running the code:
1. pip install pathos
2. pip install stochsearch
3. It is recommended that the evolution search is run on a supercomputer with multiple clusters.

ConceptualRC_2sector.py is used to evolve agents to perform the 2-slot task.
ConceptualRC_3sector.py is used to evolve agents to perform the 3-slot task.
agentanalysis_multislot_ring.py is used for visualization.

Because the code is originally created on a different platform, there may be small bugs. Please contact siyuyao@iu.edu if there there are any problems running the code and I will try to fix it.
